IA-FEMesh employs a multiblock meshing scheme aimed at hexahedral mesh generation. An emphasis has been placed on making the tools interactive, in an effort to create a user-friendly environment. The goal is to provide an efficient and reliable method for model development, visualization, and mesh quality evaluation. While these tools have been developed, initially, in the context of skeletal structures, they can be applied to a virtually endless number of modeling applications.\r\n\r\n### Purpose/Synopsis\r\nProvides an efficient and reliable method for finite element model development, visualization, and mesh quality evaluation.\r\n\r\n### Audience\r\nBiomechanical engineers interested in hexahedral mesh generation. The mesh generator should also support cardiovascular and other applications.\r\n\r\n### Long Term Goals and Related Uses\r\nProvide users with a full suite of tools for finite element model development, quality evaluation and improvement. This suite can be coupled with imaging data to assign material properties.\r\n\r\n### Build requirements\r\nCMake (>= 2.6), ITK, VTK, KWWidgets\r\n \r\n### Build instructions\r\n```\r\n$ cd ./IA-FEMesh\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout master\r\n$ cmake\r\n$ cd ./build\r\n$ make\r\n$ make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDeveloped by Musculoskeletal Imaging, Modelling and Experimentation (MIMX) Center for Computer Aided Design The University of Iowa Iowa City, IA 52242 http://www.ccad.uiowa.edu/mimx/\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) The University of Iowa.
