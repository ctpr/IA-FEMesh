<a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h3>

<p>In an effort to facilitate anatomic FE model development, we introduce IA-FE Mesh (Iowa FE Mesh), a freely available software toolkit. IA-FEMesh employs a multiblock meshing scheme aimed at hexahedral mesh generation. An emphasis has been placed on making the tools interactive, in an effort to create a user-friendly environment. The goal is to provide an efficient and reliable method for model development, visualization, and mesh quality evaluation. While these tools have been developed, initially, in the context of skeletal structures, they can be applied to a virtually endless number of modeling applications.</p>

<a id="purposesynopsis" class="anchor" href="#purposesynopsis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose/Synopsis</h3>

<p>Provides an efficient and reliable method for finite element model development, visualization, and mesh quality evaluation.</p>

<h3>
<a id="audience" class="anchor" href="#audience" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Audience</h3>

<p>Biomechanical engineers interested in hexahedral mesh generation. The mesh generator should also support cardiovascular and other applications.</p>
